# credibility_assessment

Simple Flask application to evaluate a Transition Plan PDF against a list of
questions using the OpenAI API. Results are scored according to the answers
returned by the model.
The included web interface now uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for a
cleaner look.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Provide your OpenAI API key via the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
   before running the app. You can set it in your shell or store it in a `.env`
   file and load it with a tool such as `dotenv`:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
2. Upload a PDF (max 5â€¯MB) containing the Transition Plan.
3. Click **Start Enhanced Assessment**. The application processes each question
   from `questions.json`, calls the OpenAI API and displays progress while the
   assessment is running. When finished, the answers and scores are listed.

The file `questions.json` contains the list of questions and can be replaced
with your own.
